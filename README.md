## Disclaimer ##

This assignment is meant to give us at Archii an idea of who you are as a developer and how you go about solving a problem.
Interviewing candidates from afar is hard - if you think doing the assignment is unfair, let us know! We do not intend to use the assignment for anything nor do we expect production grade code. 
Don't prepare for the assignment - use the technology you have available and know well,.


## Specification ##

Write a basic publish-subscribe API!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern

The API should provide the following functionality:

1. Register/Unregister a subscriber to a topic - can be a string	
2. Register/Unregister a publisher to a topic 
3. Publish a note to a topic
4. Receive a published note as a subscriber

Only write the API. You should write a few tests to make sure it works! (But we won't look at the tests)

## Assignment Rules ##

The assignment must comply with these rules:

1. The entire implementation must be in a single Git repository link or a single zip file. If you have tons of dependencies, consider using a build tool like Maven, Pip, npm or whatever. 
2. The assignment should take no longer than 2-3 hours: If you have used the alloted hours just hand-in what you got! We would rather see a few good lines of code than a hurried mess. On the other hand, if you think this is easy and is finished in 30 mins, be creative! Use the timeslot to show what you got
3. The code and configuration must be concise and readable. We dont care about your choice of technology - you can even use an existing publisher-subscribe framework if that is easy for you! What we care about is solving the challenge with the tools that you like to use!
4. Don't overdo the documentation. If the code is nice it is easy to see what is happening.

## IMPORTANT ## 
Please use the last 10 minutes of the assignment to write a few lines about why you chose the technologies you've used.  
e.g.: "I write in Python because it's easy to prototype...", "I used this framework because it's superior to xxx".
Remember this as a general rule of programming, and certainly you shouldn't forget it here!
