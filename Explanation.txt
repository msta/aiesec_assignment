I wrote using Ruby on Rails because I think it have a fast setup and it's way productive. The language and some caracteristics of the 
framework (DRY and Convention over Configuration) help to write a clean and meaningful code. The IRB (the Rails command line) also helps
to change and test the code very quickly. Besides this, it's the tool that I am most familiar in the moment.

A note about the Publish-Subscribe implementation:

It's done using a library called Wisper (https://github.com/krisleech/wisper).
When a post is submitted through the controller (and is successful) a signal (:post_created) is sent
(through the 'publish' method) to whom has subscribed to it, who have to implement the signal callback. 

The subscription it's done through a simple line of code:

`Wisper.subscribe(Listener.new)`
